# Shape-Based-Grasping-Techniques-with-Eye-Tracking-Device
The eye tracking algorithm allows to detect our pupil position, and then what our eyes are looking at. Training a YOLO neural network for object recognition, we can recognize the object that we want to grasp. Then a Thalmicâ€™s EMG armband is used to exploit the EMG electric signals coming from 8 electrodes around our forearm in order to understand if the user is closing or opening the hand. If the user wants to close the hand and an object is recognized, the robotic hand will close according to the technique related to the shape of the object (pinch grasp, power grasp or three-jaw chuck grasp)
